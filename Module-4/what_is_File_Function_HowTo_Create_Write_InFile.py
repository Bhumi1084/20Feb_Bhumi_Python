Q-1 : What is file function in pyhton?

=> Python supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with 
   many other file handling options, to operate on files.
   
=> The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.

=> The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

=> In Python, the open() function is used to create and open files.

=> To create and write to a file, you typically use the mode 'w' (write mode) or 'a' (append mode) with the 
   open() function.

# Open a file in create and write mode ('w')

f = open('first.txt','w')   #create or open file
f.write("This is Python.")  #write in file

f1 = open('first.txt', 'r')     #open file
print(f1.read())    #read file
