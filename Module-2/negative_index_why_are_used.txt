Q: What are negative indexes and why are they used?

=> Negative indexing allows you to access elements of a sequence from the end.

=> Negative indexing is used to in python to begin slicing from the end of the string.

=> For example, in a string with 5 characters, the last character can be accessed using the index -1, the 
   second last character using the index -2, and so on.

=> Example: 
    str="This is python"
    print("Last character : ",str[-1:])     #output: n
    print("Second last character : ",str[-2:])      #output: on
